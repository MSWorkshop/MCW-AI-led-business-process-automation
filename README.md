# AI-led business process automation

## This workshop is archived and no longer being maintained.  Content is read-only.

Contoso Healthcare is a major hospital network consisting of multiple locations across the United States. One of Contoso Healthcare's most significant needs is to have the ability to process handwritten and electronically filled medical claims forms. Currently, each hospital uploads image representations of completed forms via an Azure File Share. Employees then review each document and enter data manually into the claims system. Contoso Healthcare is looking to automate the business process of extracting claims form data and provide valuable reporting visualizations from the claims data ingested.

In addition to claims processing, Contoso Healthcare needs to transcribe, translate, and store patient/doctor visit audio recordings. A key benefit to obtaining audio transcripts is the ability to surface valuable medical terms, dosage instructions, and diagnoses discussed. Therefore, the information transcribed needs to be analyzed and enhanced with medical labeling and provided as a source for search functionality in their web portal.

## Abstracts

### Workshop

In this workshop, you will learn to automate a business process end-to-end using a variety of Azure Cognitive Services.

At the end of this workshop, you will be better able to architect and implement a business process automation solution that leverages Azure Cognitive Services.

### Whiteboard design session

In this whiteboard design session, you will work in a group to automate the business process of extracting data from form documents and perform visit audio transcription (and translation where required). You will evaluate Azure tools and services to design an optimal architecture that will fulfill Contoso Healthcare's business process automation requirements.

At the end of this whiteboard design session, you will be better able to architect a solution to automate and enrich an existing business process and provide further insight into data using Azure Cognitive Services.

### Hands-on lab

In this hands-on lab, you will learn to train a Form Recognizer model to extract data from images of documents and use Speech services to transcribe and translate audio. You will also learn to analyze transcribed text with Healthcare text analytics to extract medical terminology, medication dosages, and diagnoses.

At the end of this hands-on lab, you will be better able to implement a business process automation solution that leverages Azure Cognitive Services.
